# CIDL's project
# Precision in Plant Disease Diagnosis: A CNN Approach to Enhance Agricultural Practices

Our project is dedicated to addressing this critical need by harnessing the power of Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs). These neural networks are adept at learning intricate patterns and
features from images, equipping them with the capability to distinguish between healthy and
infected plants with remarkable precision

## Methodology Overview

To accomplish our goal, we will undertake a comprehensive evaluation of two CNN models: one
built from scratch and another utilizing pre-trained weights. Through a thorough analysis of various
metrics, we aim to determine which model exhibits superior accuracy in plant disease detection,
thereby contributing to the advancement of agricultural practices.

## Dataset

This dataset has been generated by applying offline augmentation techniques to the original
dataset, which is accessible on this GitHub repository: https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset.
